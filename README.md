# Scrabble Suggest

Scrabble Suggest will take as input a list of letters and output a list of Scrabble words that can be made with those letters.

This was an exercise to help me learn a bit of Go. Any feedback on improving my code is very much welcomed.

## Usage

1. Build:

        ./build.sh
This will create two executables, `scrabble-indexer` and `scrabble-suggester`
2. Index:

        ./scrabble-indexer <path to word list>
This builds the index file. A standard word list is included at `data/words.txt`. You can pass it a different word list if you have one. This only needs to be done once (unless you change the word list).
3. Run:

        ./scrabble-suggester <letters>
Lists all the Scrabble words, in order of descending point value, that can be made with the given letters.
